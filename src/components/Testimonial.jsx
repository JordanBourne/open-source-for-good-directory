        With Free Code Camp&#39;s valuable contribution, we were able to improve
        all of our systems and processes as part of our Wonder Women Eastern
        Indonesia program, and make sure that even more life changing
        technologies get to where they are needed most.

        We have been blown away by the professional quality of the work that
        has been produced by the campers working on our projects. Free Code
        Camp has been an invaluable partner and we are grateful for their
        support.

        We had the pleasure to work with two very talented campers who went
        above and beyond to create a web-based app for us. I would highly
        recommend that nonprofits apply to Free Code Camp with their custom
        solution needs!
